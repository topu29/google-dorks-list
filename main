Dork List of 2020
Here could see an example to understand how Google Darks password used by hackers to gain sensitive information from specific websites.

“inurl: domain/” “additional dorks
A hacker would simply use in the desired parameters as follows:

inurl = the URL of a site you want to query
domain = the domain for the site
dorks = the sub-fields and parameters that a hacker wants to scan
The best way to use Google dorks legally is to find vulnerabilities on your own website.

We can also use other search filed than URL that will help to uncover a lot of information about a site.

Some of the Example google dorks:
info: The query [info:] will present some information that Google has about that web page. For instance, [info:www.google.com] will show information about the Google homepage. Note there can be no space between the “info:” and the web page url.

link: The query [link:] will list webpages that have links to the specified webpage. For instance, [link:www.google.com] will list web pages that have links pointing to the Google homepage. Note there can be no space between the “link:” and the web page url.

site: If you include [site:] in your query, Google will restrict the results to those websites in the given domain.

For instance, [help site:www.google.com] will find pages about help within www.google.com. [help site:com] will find pages about help within .com urls. Note there can be no space between the “site:” and the domain.

inurl: If you include [inurl:] in your query, Google will restrict the results to documents containing that word in the url. For instance, [inurl:google search] will return documents that mention the word “google” in their url, and mention the word “search” anywhere in the document (url or no).
